# LSTM-Based-Predictive-Maintenance-Framework
Overview
This code provides a comprehensive pipeline for training and evaluating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict machine failures based on historical telemetry, maintenance records, error logs, and machine information. The solution includes advanced feature engineering, data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation using sequential data. The main focus is on building a robust predictive maintenance system capable of forecasting potential machine breakdowns.

**Key Use Cases**
1. Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment
Objective: Predict machine failures ahead of time to schedule maintenance proactively, thereby reducing unexpected downtimes and preventing costly repairs.
Application: This model can be integrated into manufacturing plants, oil and gas industries, or any sector where equipment failure can lead to significant financial loss or safety concerns.
Outcome: Improved machine reliability, extended equipment life, and optimized use of maintenance resources.
2. Anomaly Detection in Machine Operations
Objective: Detect patterns and trends that indicate abnormal machine behavior, allowing for early intervention before complete failure.
Application: Use telemetry data (e.g., sensor readings) to identify deviations from normal operational parameters that could signal potential issues.
Outcome: Early alerts and warnings that improve response times and minimize disruptions.
3. Failure Trend Analysis and Historical Insights
Objective: Provide insights into failure trends over time, helping maintenance teams understand when and why certain failures are likely to occur.
Application: Aggregated rolling statistics and maintenance frequency tracking offer valuable insights for trend analysis and predictive strategies.
Outcome: Data-driven decision-making that enhances strategic maintenance planning.
4. Operational Efficiency Improvement
Objective: Use machine learning predictions to plan maintenance schedules more effectively, aligning with production demands and minimizing impact on productivity.
Application: Implement maintenance activities during off-peak times or planned production downtimes.
Outcome: Balanced resource allocation and improved overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).
5. Risk Management and Safety Assurance
Objective: Reduce the risk of catastrophic equipment failures that could pose safety hazards to workers.
Application: Use the predictive capabilities of the model to ensure that potentially failing equipment is flagged and addressed promptly.
Outcome: Enhanced workplace safety and compliance with industry regulations.

**General Functionality**
1. Data Preprocessing
Merges data from different sources, including telemetry data, error logs, maintenance records, and machine details.
Encodes categorical data and handles missing values.
Applies feature engineering techniques such as rolling statistics and lag features to enrich the dataset with temporal context.
2. Model Architecture
An LSTM network with 12 units, BatchNormalization, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
L2 regularization is applied to the LSTM and Dense layers to ensure the model generalizes well.
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function for binary classification.
3. Training and Validation
The data is split into 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% testing.
Class weights are applied to handle class imbalance, ensuring the model pays appropriate attention to both positive and negative classes.
The model is trained using early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks to prevent overfitting and improve training efficiency.
4. Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using a classification report, which includes precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy for the test set.
The threshold for classification is set at 0.5 by default, but it can be adjusted to balance precision and recall based on specific use cases.

**Benefits of This Approach**
Data-Driven Insights: The code leverages historical data to provide actionable insights and predictions.
Adaptability: The model can be customized or retrained with new data to adapt to changing conditions or updated equipment.
Scalability: This approach can be expanded to include more complex features, more significant data sources, or different machine learning algorithms.
Proactive Maintenance: By predicting failures in advance, this model supports a shift from reactive to proactive maintenance, saving costs and time.

**Limitations and Future Enhancements**
Model Complexity: Training LSTM models can be resource-intensive; careful tuning is needed for large-scale implementations.
Data Quality: The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and completeness of the input data. Outliers or missing data should be handled carefully.
Feature Expansion: Future versions could include more advanced features like external factors (e.g., environmental data) that may influence equipment behavior.
Threshold Tuning: Adjusting the classification threshold or exploring alternative metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC) could further improve the predictive power.
